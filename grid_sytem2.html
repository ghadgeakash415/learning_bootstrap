               <h3>The History of Kargil War</h3>
<p>The roots of the Kargil War can be traced back to the tensions between India and Pakistan after the 1971 war, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. Pakistan's defeat in 1971 left a deep scar on its military psyche. General Pervez Musharraf, deeply dissatisfied with the loss, harbored resentment against India and plotted revenge for years.
