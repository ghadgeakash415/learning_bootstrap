               <h3>The History of Kargil War</h3>
<p>The roots of the Kargil War can be traced back to the tensions between India and Pakistan after the 1971 war, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. Pakistan's defeat in 1971 left a deep scar on its military psyche. General Pervez Musharraf, deeply dissatisfied with the loss, harbored resentment against India and plotted revenge for years. Musharraf's rise to power in the late 1990s coincided with an increasingly volatile situation between India and Pakistan.

In 1984, India defeated Pakistan in the Siachen Glacier, further fueling Pakistan's desire for retaliation. With both countries testing nuclear weapons in 1998, the possibility of a full-scale nuclear war became a real concern. However, diplomatic attempts to ease tensions, such as the Lahore Declaration signed by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in February 1999, failed to prevent the impending conflict.</p>
